            About Me
            </h2>
            <hr>
            
            <strong>Tell us a little about your story...</strong>
            <p>We started out with a passion to create the unimaginable in Kenya.
               Since then we have seen even larger breakthroughs than we could imagine.
               Through strategic partnerships and collaborations we have created a wide 
               and efficient network in the field of architectural design.</p>
            <strong>Why architecture and design?</strong>
            <p>Architecture and design has influenced our way of life, recreational activities and
            comfort.It has further evolved through millenia to become what it is today. SImply put its a
            millenia of undying passion for me.</p>
            <strong>What do you do when your not designing?</strong>
            <p>When I'm not designing buildings you will definetely find me photographing
               something. My passion for creativity is undying and I hope I ignite the same passion
               in you.</p>
            <strong>Last words...</strong>
            <p>If you believe in something good and you have the passion and talent for it then 
            don't lay back on your potential and work hard at it.</p>
            <p>Finally i would like to thank everyone that has been a supporter to make me reach where I am
            today. Through your collabration, ambition and hardwork we have been able to make it.
            Again thank you very much.</p>
